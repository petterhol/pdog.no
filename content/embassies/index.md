### GeoGuessr

If you play GeoGuessr, you might enjoy the map of Norway's diplomatic
missions playable on GeoGuessr.

Some of the locations is identified with a seal or flag. Some locations does not have any
"identification", embassies are located in large office buildings or similar. The criteria
for adding the embassy in the map is simply that the actual building of the
embassy is possible to view on Street View.

Due to some countries and regions lack of Street View, not all locations is represented.
These are: Afghanistan, Algerie, Brazil, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Iran, Jordan,
Kenya, China, Kosovo, Malawi, Mali, Marocco, Mosambik, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Palestina,
Saudi-Arabia, Sudan, Syria, South Sudan, Tanzania.

The following delegations are not represented either: Permanent Mission of Norway to
the African Union, The Permanent Delegation of Norway to NATO. Most of the others are in the same
building as the embassy and therefore does not have duplicate records.

Recommended game mode: 5 min, everything allowed.
